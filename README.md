# LocalMart 🛍️

**LocalMart** is a community-focused e-commerce platform that empowers local businesses by connecting them directly with nearby customers. Unlike large-scale platforms like Flipkart, Blinkit, or Meesho, LocalMart promotes sustainable shopping, local economies, and personalized services by bridging the gap between local sellers and buyers.

## 🌟 Key Highlights

- 📍 **Hyperlocal Shopping**: Prioritizes local product availability and nearby services.
- 🤝 **Direct Seller-Customer Interaction**: Chat and negotiate directly with sellers.
- 🧠 **AI Product Matching**: Upload a photo and discover similar products sold by local vendors.
- 🧵 **Service Showcase**: Sellers like tailors can display completed work and get reviews.
- 🛒 **Real-Time Inventory**: Track what’s in stock in local shops — not warehouses.
- 📦 **Seller Dashboard**: Manage incoming queries, profile, and responses.
- 💬 **Community Chat**: Customers can post requests or questions publicly, and local sellers can respond.
- 🧭 **GPS Integration**: See the location of nearby stores and delivery routes in real-time.
- 📷 **ML Kit Integration**: Uses Firebase ML Kit for image-based product detection.
